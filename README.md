# Autonomous Vehicle Project ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

This project features an autonomous vehicle capable of navigating a path and detecting obstacles. The car uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distances and LEDs to indicate its operational status. The code allows the vehicle to:

* Start autonomously after 5 seconds of being stationary at the starting point.

* Follow a track and correct itself if it deviates.

* Stop 5 cm before an obstacle, simulating "toxic waste."

* Signal with a red LED when an obstacle is detected.

* Wait for the obstacle to be removed before resuming its path.

* Use a green LED to indicate when itâ€™s in motion.


The project uses an Arduino and DC motors to control movement, ensuring safe and autonomous navigation through the course.
